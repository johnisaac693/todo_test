### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Node.js (if you haven't already):**  
   Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version. Installing Node.js also installs `npm` (Node Package Manager), which you will need.

2. **Download the project files:**  
   If you received this as a zip file, extract it. If you cloned it from GitHub, open the project folder.

3. **Open the project in your IDE or editor of choice:**  
   (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

4. **Open the terminal or command prompt in the project folder.**  
   On VS Code, you can press `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick) to open the terminal.

5. **Install the project dependencies:**  
   In the terminal, type:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs all the required libraries and tools listed in `package.json`.

6. **Run the app locally:**  
   After the installation is complete, run:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts the Vite development server.

7. **Open the app in your browser:**  
   The terminal will show a localhost address like `http://localhost:5173/`.  
   - You can Ctrl + Click the link in most terminals, or  
   - Type `o` and press Enter in the terminal if using Vite’s default shortcut, or  
   - Manually copy and paste the URL into your browser.

8. **You're all set. Enjoy the app!**
